      <h1>Learning plan:</h1>
      <hr>
      <h3>what is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h3>
      <p>
        i just want to be able to build anything i want to build. short term, I
        would like to get an mobile application on the google play store would
        be cool. Long term become a software engineer; maybe start my own
        business after I get some more experience.

      <h3>
        A description of your own strengths and limitations in relation to
        learning
      </h3>
      <p>
        I guess have natural curiosity about learning things. I don't really
        like reading that much but it's ironically the fastest way in my opinion
        to read documentation rather than watching videos to building stuff. I
        don't limit myself to one way of learning though. I tend to be more
        productive later in the day. But, I think the most important is not
        procrastinating and just starting so that you get into a state of flow.

      <h3>
        What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see
        developed in yourself while at EDA?
      </h3>
      <p>
        I have no expectation of developing human skills. In my experience some
        of the people with the worst human/soft skills have been those that
        espouse them.

      <h3>
        A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.
        This should include:
      </h3>

      <h3>
        An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and
        safely with other learners, facilitators and industry/community
        representatives.
      </h3>
      <p>
        Because it's Remote these aspects barely apply. All I can really do is
        manage myself and how I react to external events; I'm not going to try
        to control the other people, aspects/variables, nor tell people how to
        act; that is up to them.
      </p>

      <h3>
        What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you.
      </h3>
      <p>This is a leading question, it should say "if".</p>
      <hr>
      <h3>
        A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way
      </h3>
      <p>I know people I can ask for help with programming stuff.</p>
      <hr>
      <h3>A description of what you expect from the facilitation team</h3>
      <p>
        I have rock bottom expectations; I honestly expect this programme to be
        bad.
      </p>
      <hr>
      <h3>
        Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are
        committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau
        commitments like school drop-offs. It’s important to plan these in.
      </h3>
      <p>
        I have made myself free for the duration of this programme. However, I
        commit before 6am and after 9pm to sleeping.
