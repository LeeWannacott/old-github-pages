    <h3>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h3>
    <p>
      I just want to be able to build anything I want to build. Short term, I
      would like to get an mobile application on the google play store. Long
      term become a software engineer; maybe start my own business after I get
      some more experience.

    <h3>
      A description of your own strengths and limitations in relation to
      learning
    </h3>
    <p>
      I guess have natural curiosity about learning things. I don't really like
      reading that much but it's ironically the fastest way in my opinion to
      read documentation rather than watching videos to building stuff. I don't
      limit myself to one way of learning though. I tend to be more productive
      later in the day. But, I think the most important is not procrastinating
      and just starting
    </p>

    <h3>
      What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed
      in yourself while at EDA?
    </h3>
    <p>
      I have no expectation of developing human skills. In my experience some of
      the people with the worst human/soft skills have to be those that espouse
      them.

    <h3>
      A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This
      should include:
    </h3>

    <h3>
      An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and
      safely with other learners, facilitators and industry/community
      representatives.
    </h3>
    <p>Because it's Remote these aspects barely apply.</p>
    <h3>
      What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you.
    </h3>
    <p>This is a leading question, it should say "if".</p>
    <h3>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h3>

    <p>I know people I can ask for help with programming stuff.</p>
    <h3>A description of what you expect from the facilitation team</h3>
    <p>I have rock bottom expectations; I expect this programme to be bad.</p>
    <h3>
      Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed
      to other things. For example, you might have whānau commitments like
      school drop-offs. It’s important to plan these in.
    </h3>
    <p>
      I have made myself free for the duration of this programme. However, I
      commit before 6am and after 9pm to sleep
