      <h2>
        What are three new you have learned about yourself and your ego as a
        result of the core learning?
      </h2>
      I don't know maybe I know more than what I think I do in perspective;
      working on projects and trying to figure it out along the way is probably
      harder than doing a course to learn things. But doing online distance
      courses with limited interaction gets boring after a while and at the end
      of the day its all about building stuff. I'm one in what eight billion
      people I don't know that I'm that important with regards to ego. I think
      because I learnt programming later in life because I wasn't exposed to it
      at an early age that I will be less likely to be arrogant because the
      memories of struggling to learn programming are fresher in my mind than
      they would be as a kid; because kids pick up stuff when they aren't even
      trying to.

      <h2>
        What are the role of values, empathy and self awareness in learning and
        programming?
      </h2>
      Having values that roughly align with others in the workplace might create
      cohesion in a team; that is not to say all your values should or will be
      the same as others in a team, but enough common ground that you can
      co-exist. Being self aware is important otherwise you could end up rubbing
      people the wrong way and contribute to a toxic work environment. Being
      empathetic is important as a teacher because those that teach often were
      ~A+ students themselves so the content may have been easy to learn to
      them, or they just can't remember the struggle because they learnt
      programming at a young age; being able to put yourself in the perspective
      of a learner that knows nothing and is bombarded with new terminology that
      might be confusing.

      <h2>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h2>
      I don't think there is anything that was surprising I have already read up
      on the brain and neuroplasticity. I like stoic philosophy which kind ties
      into growth mindset. I feel aware; I think getting a good amount of sleep
      helps alertness etc.
      <hr />
      <h2>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h2>
      "Learning" stuff I have already learnt about I get bored easily; that's
      why I like technology there is always new stuff to learn.
      <hr />
      <h2>
        Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time
        focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?
      </h2>
      Because you think it's important and that human skills can be taught?. In
      a software development environment you have to collaborate with others; so
      having good social skills are important to make others feel at ease. But,
      I think that comes with time and is somewhat determined by personality and
      experiences in life.
      <hr />
      <h2>
        Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of
        time? Should you have just used that time to practising programming
        instead? Justify your answer.
      </h2>
      Yeah, probably is a bit of waste of a time; compared to the opportunity
      cost, that's not to say that I do not think that social/human skills
      aren't important; However, I think they come over time and experiences in
      life, not five weeks focusing on the theory of human skills, although
      perhaps that makes you more aware of aspects of human skills and awareness
      is the first step in marketing.
