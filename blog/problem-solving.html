      <h1>Problem solving:</h1>
      Got blocked on a simple problem: I didn't necessarily get blocked; but I
      did complicate the super_fizzbuzz() problem by not calling fizzbuzz() and
      instead writing the logic for it.
      <br />
      <br />
      <pre><code style="font-size:1rem" data-language="js">
      function fizzbuzz(num) {
        if (num % 5 === 0 && num % 3 === 0 && num % 15 === 0){
        return "FizzBuzz"
      } else if(num % 3 ===0) {
        return "Fizz"
      } else if(num % 5 ===0) {
        return "Buzz"
      } else { 
        return num
        };
      }

      function super_fizzbuzz(arr) {
        arr.forEach((element,index) => {
          if(element % 15 == 0){arr[index] = "FizzBuzz"
            } else if(element % 3 === 0){arr[index] = "Fizz"
            } else if(element % 5 === 0){arr[index] = "Buzz"
            }
        })
        return arr
      }
        </code></pre>
      <br />
      <br />
      By calling FizzBuzz(), SuperFizzBuzz() Becomes:
      <br />
      <br />
      <pre><code style="font-size:1rem" data-language="js">

      function super_fizzbuzz(arr) {
        arr.forEach((element,index) => arr[index] = fizzbuzz(element));
        return arr
       }
      </code></pre>
      <br />
      <br />
      Solved a problem in an elegant way:
      <br />
      <br />
      <pre><code style="font-size:1rem" data-language="js">
        // no split() ,or filtering() required by using replace() and a regular expression. 
        // (g) means look globally for any bees in the string
        // the (i) means don't worry about case sensitivity. 
        function deBee (str){ 
          beeLessString = str.replace(/bees/gi,"") 
          return beeLessString 
        }
      </code></pre>

      <h2>
        Reflect on how confident you feel using the problem solving techniques
        and process:
      </h2>
      <h3>Pseudocode:</h3>
      I usually pseudo-code what the code should do in my head; because I
      visualize solving the problem. I often think about how to solve
      the problem in pseudo code and then think about what the syntax in Python
      would be and then translate it/ find the equivalent in another language.
      <h3>Trying something:</h3>
      I'm good at trying different things/experimenting, it is however a time
      consuming way to develop, at some point it becomes more efficient just to
      ask someone for help. However one might not feel comfortable asking for
      help and that is somewhat dependent on the culture of the organization you
      work at.
      <h3>Rubber ducky method:</h3>
      I don't personally own a rubber ducky, however: It's not always a rubber
      ducky sometimes you go to explain the issue to someone else and you figure
      the answer out half way through explaining your issue to them. Maybe you
      could talk out-loud to yourself, but then you might be considered crazy?
      So you need the rubber ducky there so they don't haul you off to the
      asylum for talking to yourself.
      <h3>Reading error messages:</h3>
      Reading error messages often ties in with Googling. Sometimes the error
      message is actually somewhat unrelated to what you have to fix; in essence
      a Red Herring.
      <h3>Console.logging():</h3>
      I use console.log() quite a bit, sometimes it makes me feel guilty for not
      running a debugger, or really having much experience in using a debugger
      and setting breakpoints. Especially in larger project using a debugger I
      imagine becomes more important. Because most of the projects I work on are
      of a small scale and usually my own projects I can get away with using
      console.log() liberally.
      <h3>Googling:</h3>
      I would say this is either my first ,or second port of call after trying
      something. I've gotten better at Googling; it can depend on the specific
      sentence you write, the terms you use and the order of the sentence.
      <h3>Asking your peers for help:</h3>
      I have not needed to ask peers for help yet. I attempted to help answer
      some peers questions though; whilst being aware of trying not to spread
      misinformation, whether it's helpful, or not I'm not sure. I should
      perhaps try giving examples rather than linking MDN (Mozzilla Developer
      Network) documentation that might be confusing to beginners; Hell I know I
      get super confused reading the official ECMA (European Computer
      Manufacturing Association; great name for documentation maintainer by the
      way :/) JavaScript documentation that outlines the
      specifications/standards for JavaScript.
      <h3>Asking coaches for help:</h3>
      I have yet to ask coaches/facilitator for help yet. Their help might be
      useful in bootcamp for the personal project.
      <h3>Improving your process with reflection:</h3>
      I reflect on a daily basis; I'm not really sure how I would improve it,
      because it's something that inherently just happens.
