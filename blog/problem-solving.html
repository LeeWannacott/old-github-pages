Got blocked on a simple problem
Solved a problem in an elegant way.


<h2>Reflect on how confident you feel using the problem solving techniques and
  process:</h2>
<h3>Pseudocode:</h3>
I usually pseudocode what the code should do in my head; because I visualize the
problem solving process. I often think in Python and then translate/find the
equivalant in other languages.
<h3>Trying something:</h3>
I'm good at trying different things; it is however a time consuming way to
develop, at some point it becomes more efficient just to ask someone for help.
However one might not feel comfortable asking for help and that is really
dependent on the culture the organization has cultivated. 
<h3>Rubber ducky method:</h3>
It's not always a rubber ducky sometimes you go to explain the issue to someone
else and you figure the answer out half way through explaining your issue to
them.
<h3>Reading error messages:</h3>
Reading error messages often ties in with Googling.
<h3>Console.logging():</h3>
I use console.log() quite a bit, sometimes it makes me feel guilty for not
running a debugger, or really having much experience in using a debugger and
setting breakpoints.
Especially in larger project using a debugger I imagine becomes more important.
Because most of the projects I work on are of a small scale and usually my own
projects I can get away with using console.log().
<h3>Googling:</h3>
I would say this is either my first ,or second port of call after trying
somethting. Ive definately
gotten better at Googling.
<h3>Asking your peers for help:</h3>
I havn't needed to ask peers for help yet. I have helped answer some peers
questions though.
<h3>Asking coaches for help:</h3>
I havn't needed to ask coaches/facilitator yet.
<h3>Improving your process with reflection:</h3>
I reflect on a daily basis.
