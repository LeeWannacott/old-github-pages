      <h1>Using the evidence gathered, describe your core personal values.</h1>
      On my Myers-Briggs online assessments I get results very polarised towards
      the INTP personality; high 90s in each of the letters/metrics. Notable
      presumed INTPs include: Bill Gates, Albert Einstein, Isaac Newton, Rene
      Descartes. I have been told that I am good at listening to what others are
      saying and that I am wise, although that person first tried to call me
      intelligent to which I responded that I thought that it was pretentious
      for them to insinuate that they had the intelligence to judge my
      intelligence; to which they responded: yes, but you are wise; that
      individual had been in some pretty high up senior management positions. I
      think they respected me challenging them .

      <h2>
        Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make.
        Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the
        decision you made and the consequences of the action you took.
      </h2>

      <h2>
        Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity.
      </h2>
      I don't put much weight on what culture, family, tradition, or society
      think. I am adaptable to my environment. As Bruce Lee once said: be like
      water. I would say that I value: liberty, freedom, stoicism, fiscal
      conservatism, independence.

      <h2>
        Using the evidence gathered, describe your strengths and limitations.
      </h2>

      STRENGTHS: Analytical – I spend much time analysing stuff. Original –
      Because I don't really look at society and live in my own head, sometimes
      I come up with original/different stuff. Open-Minded – I am able to
      explore ideology without adopting the ideals. Curious – I have an innate
      curiosity I like learning about stuff. Objective – I am interested in the
      truth even if it hurts. WEAKNESSES: Paralysis from analysis: being too
      open-minded can cause me to be indecisive. Get bored easily – I like
      learning most about something and then move onto something else; which is
      part of the reason why I like tech; there is always something to learn.
      Disconnected – Sometimes I get lost daydreaming.

      <h2>
        Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and
        career development
      </h2>

      <h2>
        Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey
        and how they might intersect with learning obstacles.
      </h2>

      <h2>
        Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work
        productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss
        the strategies you used at that time, how effective they were, and your
        reflections on what other strategies you would try now, and why.
      </h2>
      There was a group project with three members(including myself) and one
      group member before the project even begun expressed concerns(to me and
      teaching staff) about the other group member and basically said that they
      thought they would do no work. I thought it was a little premature to make
      that allegation before the project had even begun and advised that,
      although I guess in the end they were proven correct as the group member
      didn't really do much or even turn up. But I believe in innocence until
      proven guilty.
