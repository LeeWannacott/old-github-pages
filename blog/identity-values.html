      <h1>Using the evidence gathered, describe your core personal values.</h1>
      On my Myers-Briggs online assessments I get results very polarised towards
      the INTP personality; high 90s in each of the letters/metrics.
      <br />
      <br />
      <h3>Introversion:</h3>
      Get tired excessively interacting with others.
      <br />
      <br />
      <h3>Intuitive:</h3>
      Look to yourself rather than the outside world; live inside your own mind.
      <br />
      <br />
      <h3>Thinking:</h3>
      Thinking/logic rather than feeling/emotion.
      <br />
      <br />
      <h3>Perceiving:</h3>
      Observant rather than judgemental, limited planning.
      <br />
      <br />
      <h3>Notable presumed INTPs include:</h3>
      Bill Gates, Albert Einstein, Isaac Newton, Rene Descartes.

      I have been told that I am good at listening to what others are saying and
      that I am wise; although that person first tried to call me intelligent to
      which I cheekily replied that I thought that it was pretentious for them
      to insinuate that they had the intelligence to judge my intelligence; to
      which they responded: yes, but you are wise; that individual had been in
      some pretty high up senior management positions, I think they respected me
      challenging them .

      <h2>
        Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make.
        Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the
        decision you made and the consequences of the action you took.
      </h2>

      When I was a teaching assistant and marking a students work it became
      apparent to me that they had copied all their answers verbatim from the
      internet; I dealt with it by notifying the teacher. As far as I'm
      concerned that's all I'm required to do ethically. The teacher dealt with
      it by giving them a chance to retry the assignment. I wrote assignments
      for students exploring ethical issues, but the marking wasn't done in a
      way that penalised students for their personal views, or position on
      whether a situation was ethical or not; rather in a way that gave points
      for any valid reasoning/arguments they could give for the position they
      state.. It's my opinion that Ethics is subjective there is no
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_absolutism"
        >Moral absolutism</a
      >. <br /><br />How you make a decision might still be affected by how you
      are perceived (reputation; would you want this act published in the
      newspaper); how you think society will perceive your actions (when in
      Rome)
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_relativism"
        >Moral relativism</a
      >. Considerations of legality and the punishment and the possibility of
      incarceration; but of course legality is not necessarily concerned with
      morality, or equity. Integrity's definition is: Honesty whilst having good
      morals *it doesn't define what good morals are); what is considered good
      generally is related to survival of the group; which may be secured by
      giving up some liberty

      I think Kohlberg's stages of moral development is a good theory in my
      opinion for looking at where we get our morality from:

      <h2>
        Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity.
      </h2>
      I don't put much weight on what culture, family, tradition, or society
      think. I am adaptable to my environment. As Bruce Lee once said: be like
      water. I would say that I value: liberty, freedom, stoicism, fiscal
      conservatism, independence. I think the last place you should get your
      values and identity from is culture ,or society in my opinion; unless you
      want to end up like Socrates.

      <h2>
        Using the evidence gathered, describe your strengths and limitations.
      </h2>

      <h3>STRENGTHS:</h3>
      <br />
      Analytical: I spend much time analysing stuff. Original – Because I don't
      really look at society and live in my own head, sometimes I come up with
      original/different stuff.
      <br />
      <br />
      Open-Minded: I am able to explore ideology without adopting the ideals.
      Curious – I have an innate curiosity I like learning about stuff.

      <br />
      <br />

      Objective: I am interested in the truth even if it hurts.

      <br />
      <br />
      <h3>LIMITATIONS:</h3>
      <br />
      Paralysis from analysis: being too open-minded can cause me to be
      indecisive.

      <br />
      <br />
      Get bored easily: I like learning most about something and then move onto
      something else; which is part of the reason why I like technology; there
      is always something to learn.

      <br />
      <br />
      Disconnected/introspective: Sometimes I get lost daydreaming in my own
      head without regard to the outside world.

      <br />
      <br />
      <hr />
      <h2>
        Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and
        career development
      </h2>
      I think the early stages/foundations might be difficult because I already know
      quite a bit of the content so I have to fight of boredom.

      <br />
      <br />
      I think my personality is probably a good fit for software development and
      maybe teaching others; my lecturer thought I was a good fit for a teaching assistant
      , So maybe that ties into being able to help others learn to code.

      <br />
      <br />
      Sometimes if I have competing things to learn or do; I become like a deer in 
      the headlights and procrastinating doing either thing because I can't decide
      what to learn ,or do.

      <br />
      <br />
      <hr />
      <h2>
        Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey
        and how they might intersect with learning obstacles.
      </h2>
      Being easy going I think will help others feel okay about interacting with
      me and hopefully others will welcome help from me.
      <br />
      <br />
      Being natural curious helps to keep learning new things; you don't want
      to stop learning and be left behind in the technology sector.
      <br />
      <br />
      Being open-minded helps consider alternative ways of solving problems and gives
      the ability to think outside the box.

      <h2>
        Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work
        productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss
        the strategies you used at that time, how effective they were, and your
        reflections on what other strategies you would try now, and why.
      </h2>
      <hr />
      There was a group project with three members (including myself) and one
      group member before the project even begun expressed concerns(to me and
      teaching staff) about the other group member and basically said that they
      thought they would do no work. I thought it was a little premature to make
      that allegation before the project had even begun and advised that,
      although I guess in the end they were proven correct as the group member
      didn't really do much, or even turn up. But I believe in innocence until
      proven guilty and its not my place to accuse someone; I think the only
      thing I can do is control how I react to situations, I'm not going to tell
      others how to live their life..
