      <h2>1. An analogy to describe the differences between HTML and CSS</h2>
      If you were writing a book HTML is the words on the page; CSS would 
      describe where the page numbers are, the font, whether the title has fancy typography,
      that quotes are indented on both sides, how far across a page before the
      words should wrap, the colour theme if any of the book. Whereas HTML is the title,
      the paragraph and the pictures, CSS would determine the size of the pictures
      and where they are layed out..

        2. Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday
        life, for example 'waking up' or 'brushing your teeth'. (But not those
        ones).
      </h2>
      Control flow refers to the order in which the computer executes code.
      Loops are super handy for example when we go to the supermarket with a
      shopping list to check if we have the items in our cart we loop through
      the list and if (if statements/conditionals) we have it in the cart we
      check it off our list. In real life it might be more like a hunt and find;
      not a strict looping process. But with computers it makes sense to
      explicity use a loop and we have to be very specific with telling the
      computer what to do.

        3. Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact
        with it.
      </h2>
      The HTML DOM outlines the structure of Objects that exist in a browser
      window and web page/document of which you can call methods and properties
      with. Like for example you might want to get the width and height of the
      browser window which you can get by using the Window Object property Window.screen.width
      or Window.screen.height.
