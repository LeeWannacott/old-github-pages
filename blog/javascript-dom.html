      <h2>1. An analogy to describe the differences between HTML and CSS</h2>
      If you were writing a book HTML is the words on the page; CSS would
      describe where the page numbers are, the font, whether the title has fancy
      typography, that quotes are indented on both sides, how far across a page
      before the words should wrap, the colour theme if any of the book
      (another words the style). Whereas
      HTML is the title, the paragraph and the pictures another words the
      structures (like bones in a body), CSS would determine the
      size of the pictures and where they are layed out..

        2. Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday
        life, for example 'waking up' or 'brushing your teeth'. (But not those
        ones).
      </h2>
      Control flow refers to the order in which the computer executes code.
      Loops are super handy for example when we go to the supermarket with a
      shopping list to check if we have the items in our cart we loop through
      the list and if (if statements/conditionals) we have it in the cart we
      check it off our list. In real life it might be more like a hunt and find;
      not a strict looping process. But with computers it makes sense to
      explicity use a loop and we have to be very specific with telling the
      computer what to do.

        3. Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact
        with it.
      </h2>
      The HTML DOM outlines the structure of Objects that exist in a browser
      window (Chrome, firefox, etc...) and web page/document of which you can
      call methods and properties with. Like for example you might want to get
      the width and height of the browser window which you can get by using the
      Window Object's property Window.screen.width ,or/and Window.screen.height.

        4. Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and
        objects.
      </h2>
      Data can be accessed from Objects by using dot notation. Object.property
      to access properties; which is a variable belonging to an Object and
      Object.method() for methods; which is a function you can call that belongs
      to an Object.

      <br />
      <br />
      Arrays are accesed by using square brackets with an index number. Like so:
      Array[0]
      <br />
      <h3>
        Example accessing Object's properties with dot noation or brackets:
      </h3>
      <br />
      var vehicle ={ boat : 'Boaty McBoatFace' plane : 'Boeing 747' car : 'Ford
      Escort MK II' }
      <br />
      vehicle.boat or vehicle['plane'] returns: Boaty McBoatFace and Boeing 747
      <br />
      <br />
      <h3>Example accessing array with indexing:</h3>
      <br />
      const cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];
      <br />
      let x = cars[0]; // x = "Saab"

      <h2>5. Explain what functions are and why they are useful.</h2>

      functions take inputs and have a series of steps/processes that do
      something with the input and then return an output (except for pure
      functions which have no side-effects to the input). <br /><br />Think of
      baking a cake which takes ingredients as input (parameters in function)
      and inside the function it will do operations (like mixing ingredients,
      putting it in the oven) to bake the cake and then returns an output (a
      baked cake).
      <br />
      <br />

      <br />
      <br />
      functions are useful because it allows us to encapsulate data inside of
      the function so that processes dont affect other parts of our code and
      cause potential bugs.
