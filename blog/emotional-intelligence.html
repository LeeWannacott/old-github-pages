      <h2>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h2>
      Wikipedia says: "Emotional intelligence is most often defined as the
      ability to perceive, use, understand and manage emotions. People with high
      emotional intelligence can recognize their own emotions and those of
      others, use emotional information to guide thinking and behavior, discern
      between different feelings and label them appropriately, and adjust
      emotions to adapt to environments." So yeah basically being able to figure
      out how you are feeling (Which emotion you are feeling; if any. Unless
      your a sociopath/psycopath) and being able to read social situations and
      make others feel at ease and engaged with you.

      <h2>How is it different to IQ?</h2>
      IQ is designed to measure individuals intelligence accross a range of
      standardized tests. I think people tend to associate IQ test with Ravens
      Progressive which measures abstract geometrical reasoning (to account for
      intelligence that may not be easily perceivable from verbal reasoning and
      language skills, e.g some people can't read, write, or speak) which in my
      opinion isn't really reflective of the problems that people face in the
      real world; of which I think the main one is effectively communicating
      with others which would argueably fall under Emotional intelligence. There
      are other tests falling under IQ that measure verbal reasoning, listening
      skills ,etc... Emotional intelligence is I think somewhat harder to
      measure because interactions with others are somewhat subjective and you
      have to read between the lines, it's easy to have a failure to communicate
      clearly and be understood; as to what you were trying to really say. There
      is a disconnect between thoughts and what comes out of someones mouth.

      <h2>Why is it important?</h2>
      Leading question that leaves no room for counter-argument. There are
      people who would be considered EQ challenged like Linus Torvalds that are
      still extremely successful at what they do; It takes all sorts. People
      with aspergers notoriously have little ability to gauge social situations
      that doesn't mean that they can't make meaningful contributions to
      society. That said life is probably on the whole much easier for those
      people that can interact with others well and make them feel at ease. The
      biggest predicter of financial/career success is actually the ability to
      delay gratification (which seems to fall under emotional intelligence?) 
      which is essentially what work is..
