      <h1>1. Research Neuroplasticity</h1>
      <h2>
        Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits
        people:
      </h2>
      The principles of Neuroplasticity help people in the sense that it allows
      individuals to make new pathways in the brain which may help individuals
      to learn new skills quicker than if the brain was at fixed state and
      couldn't make new pathways/connections.
      <h2>
        Discuss how you might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for
        your own benefit:
      </h2>
      By trying out new activities that the brain isn't used to performing; the
      brain will make new pathways ,or strengthen pathways that already exist,
      but are underutilized. For example learning an instrument, doing
      brainteasers, puzzles or Sudoku if you never do it before, or done the
      problem before.

      <h2>What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?</h2>
      Learning a new language (might apply to programming languages as well?).
      Travelling to new environments/countries. Make art, music, creative
      endeavours (programming has a creative aspect; creativity within the
      bounds of logic). New exercises can build muscle memory and other benefits
      like balance coordination ,etc.

      <h1>2. Research Growth Mindset</h1>

      <h2>Discuss what it is and why it is relevant</h2>
      Growth Mindset is the notion that we are not fixed by our inherent
      intelligence, abilities, skills we are born with. Growth mindset states
      that it is in our domain to change; another words we are the captain of
      our own ship. Roman philosopher Seneca said:
      <i>"Luck is what happens when preparation meets opportunity."</i>

      Which is a way of saying we make our own luck.

      <h2>In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</h2>
      No, It is something I have already thought about; I think there are some
      programmers who are extremely intelligent and come from highly scientific
      and mathematical backgrounds; however generally I find programming
      different from math; although it can involve complicated algorithms most
      are pretty simple. I think generally their is a mix of nature and nurture;
      people do start out with certain personality traits, or brain structures.
      (Allegedly 80% of the brain is formed by five years old).
      <br>
      <br>
      Consistency is a super important aspect for both building muscle memory
      and getting better at solving problems; if you put it all down to a fixed
      mindset of not being able to change; then you never will. I have a believe
      that I can get better for example I took my typing speed from ~30wpm to
      ~60wpm by learning touch typing.
      <h2>How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?</h2>
      By not getting discouraged if I do not learn something fast ,or figure
      something out straight off the bat ,or get stuck on a problem. I acknowledge that it
      takes time to get comfortable with being uncomfortable.

      <h1>3. Blend with your learning plan and strategies</h1>
      By learning and experiencing building new applications and using new
      technologies it will expand my capabilities like a rubber band (that
      hopefully doesn't snap) and having new experiences with new people in the
      workplace will help me grow as a person.

      <h2>
        Reflect and discuss how these understandings may shape or influence your
        learning plan and strategy.
      </h2>
      These understanding might shape my learning plan and strategy by being
      more ambitious because the more stressful I make the situation and the
      more learning I pile on the more adaption may occur in my cranium. The
      more you look at the code the more comfortable you become; perhaps part of
      that is that the brain is adapting and creating new pathways that are
      doing pattern recognition of code, like how we know the meanings of certain words,
      even if we can't give the dictionary definition for those words; we
      implicitly have an understanding, or how pro chess players rely on pattern
      recognition to identify positions they have previously played on parts of
      the chess board.
