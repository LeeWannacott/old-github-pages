<h1>1. Research Neuroplasticity</h1>

<h2>Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits
  people:</h2>

The principles of neuroplasticity help people in the sense that it allows
individuals to make new pathways in the brain which may help individuals to learn new
skills quicker than if the brain was at fixed state and couldn't make new
pathways/connections.  

<h2>Discuss how you might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for your
  own benefit</h2>
By trying out new activities that the brain isn't used to performing; the brain
will make new pathways ,or strengthen pathways that already exist, but are underutilized.
For example learning an instrument, doing brainteasers, puzzles or Sudoku if you
never do it before, or done the problem before.

<h2>What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?</h2>
Learning a new language (might apply to programming languages as well?). Travelling
to new environments (new countries?). Make art, music, creative endeavours (programming has a
creative aspect; creativity within the bounds of logic). New exercises can build
muscle memory and other benefits like balance coordination ,etc.
